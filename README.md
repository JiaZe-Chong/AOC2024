# Advent of Code 2024

This will be the repo where I store my AOC solutions,

## Goals

- Learn `Go`.
- No AI.
- No external libraries.

## Running the code
- Clone this repo.
- Change the current working directory, `cd Day{day number}`
- Make sure the input files are present
- Run the main code `go run main.go`
